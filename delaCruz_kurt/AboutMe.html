                <span class="text2">I was born on October 10, 2003 at Baguio Genral Hospital. I'm the youngest in my family and we consist of 6 family members. I have a friendly and sweet personality and I really like to talk a lot with other people. I like joking around with my friends even if we make fun of each other we are still happy. Currently I'm an BSIT student and hoping to be a successful software engineer in the future.:></span>
